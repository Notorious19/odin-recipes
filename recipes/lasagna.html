        <h2>Bitch Lasagna:</h2>
        <img src="../images/Lasagne_alla_bolognese_main.jpeg" alt="Thor's Lasagna">
        <p>Some vegetables such as carrots and tomatoes contain a type of antioxidant that is more easily absorbed by your body than its crunchy raw counterpart. Both carrots and tomatoes are highly welcome in a lasagna, in addition to onion and garlic. The latter being described as natural antibiotics.</p>

            <p> The meat sauce in lasagna is the same sauce as in spaghetthi bolognese. A rather meaty affair with a little bit tomato and carrots. What I like to do with the lasagna is use more carrots and grate them. Originally a teqnique to make children eat more vegetables, it is also a way to make a more integrated and greener sauce, which also reduces the cooking time. Do put cherry tomatoes on top to make the lasagna greener.</p>
            
            <p> The main difference between lasagne and spaghetti bolognese, two classic Italian dishes from the ”Italian heartland” of Emilia-Romagna north in Italy, is the type of pasta and the making of a white sauce with cheese. The type of cheese depends on geography. Lasagna is made with parmesan in the north and mozarella or ricotta in the south. And did you know, in Italy lasagna is served at Christmas?</p>
            
            <p>  Lasagna is delicious, but it is easy to mess up. It should keep its shape, but still be succulent. Make sure your white sauce is quite thick and bake it long enough. And do the same as with a good steak. Let the lasagna rest, for at least 10 minutes, in order for it to absorb liquid. Also, make a double portion and freeze the rest, as it is freezing well.</p>

        </ol>

                <li>Bake in the middle of the oven at 175C for about 30–40 minutes until golden. Allow the dish to rest for at least 10 minutes for the lasagne to absorb the liquid. Drizzle with extra olive oil and serve with a salad of your choice.</li>
